End of day.

s project will use that lens to assess the impact of the COVID epidemic and the public health policies
to contain COVID on SES-related health disparities. The resulting assessment will be provided to policymakers in a
timely and relevant manner in order to inform an equitable policy response to this public health crisis.
The project team includes experts in health services research, epidemiology, public health, health disparities,
economics, statistics and education who will use sophisticated modelling and analytical techniques and timely access
to data on health outcomes, SES and employment to investigate the cross-SES health impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic, and of the containment measures used to mitigate that pandemic in Ontario.
The objectives are to:
1. Measure the set of defined health outcomes across SES strata before and after March 2020 using best available
data;
2. Model observed impacts of COVID and containment on a defined set of health outcomes across SES strata using
sophisticated statistical techniques.
