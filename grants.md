##The current project directly addresses the identified need for population-based longitudinal studies of breast cancer survivors. To address these gaps in knowledge this study has two main objectives:

1)	Determine the incidence of treatment-related late-effects and how these are associated with specific treatment modalities.
2)	Identify the major causes of death overall and by treatment, examining the impact of comorbidities at diagnosis and late-effects of treatment.

##Only now, with 15-20 years of follow-up time, can we address this major research gap by assessing long-term patient outcomes within a real-world setting. 

The current project directly addresses the identified need for population-based longitudinal studies of breast cancer survivors. 

To address these gaps in knowledge this study has three main objectives: In a cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2001 and 2020 we will:

1) Examine the risk of second primary contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and other second cancer
diagnoses.

2) Determine the incidence of treatment-related late-effects.

3) Examine non-breast cancer causes of death.
